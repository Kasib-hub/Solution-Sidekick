SOLUTION SIDEKICK (SolSide)

C1 * V1 = C2 * V2

I want the app to have users and allow them to make dilutions
  * name the dilutions, save to user, CREATE
  * READ - make like a feed for the dilutions, let all user see. Perhaps vote on popular ones?
  * UPDATE - can go back in change numbers, change if they want to dilute it further, increase volume?
  * DELETE - let users delete their own creations
  * let people name the solvents and solutes in the dilution

CRUD, React, Django are required.
  -> We need atleast 3 api calls 

  Can you write your own apis to use in the project? yes, but it isn't recommended.

On the api stuff
  - perhaps the dilution can also return a wiki page on the solution you wrote in on random blood antigen groups
  - incorporate 
    

Chad thinks its a good idea. Maybe incorporate an AI chat bot. I was thinking about that!
  - uses chatgpt and python library, and make plots. 

() I could stand to implement user authentication first before diving into react
