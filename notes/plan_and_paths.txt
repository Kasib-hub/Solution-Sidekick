SOLUTION SIDEKICK (SolSide)

C1 * V1 = C2 * V2

I want the app to have users and allow them to make dilutions
  * name the dilutions, save to user, CREATE
  * READ - make like a feed for the dilutions, let all user see. Perhaps vote on popular ones?
  * UPDATE - can go back in change numbers, change if they want to dilute it further, increase volume?
  * DELETE - let users delete their own creations
  * let people name the solvents and solutes in the dilution

CRUD, React, Django are required.
  -> We need atleast 3 api calls 

  Can you write your own apis to use in the project? yes, but it isn't recommended.

On the api stuff
  - perhaps the dilution can also return a wiki page on the solution you wrote in on random blood antigen groups
  - incorporate 
    

Chad thinks its a good idea. Maybe incorporate an AI chat bot. I was thinking about that!
  - uses chatgpt and python library, and make plots. 

() I could stand to implement user authentication first before diving into react

WikiAPI EX:
  - Getting antigen system:
      https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=extracts&titles=Duffy_antigen_system&format=json&exsentences=2&explaintext=1&formatversion=2
  
  - WikiSearches
        https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=opensearch&search=bsa&limit=10&namespace=0&format=json&category=science&formatversion=2

  - not working
  https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=opensearch&search=<query>&namespace=0&limit=10&format=json&formatversion=2&redirects=resolve&category=Science%7CMedicine

REQUIREMENTS
A few of you have already talked with me about your projects.
For those of you who like lists, here are the official requirements for Personal Projects (Assessment 5):
  Use Django for Backend
  Use React for Frontend
  CRUD resources
  Use at least 2 3rd party APIs
  Authentication (optional but encouraged)
  Make it look good
If you have an idea that doesn't conform with the above, talk to me and we'll work something out.
Once you have been given the OK by an instructor, please fill out this spreadsheet:

* I'm trying to make an edit page but it should look nearly the same as the createPage or just make a createSol component and EditSol component
